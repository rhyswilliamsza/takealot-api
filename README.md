# Unofficial Takealot API

Frontend Takealot API Written in NodeJS, based on Takealot's existing REST API

Goals:
- Search Through Products
- Find Details about Specific Product
- Check for changes in prices of competitor products (price-matching)
- Much more

This was inspired through a reseller store on takealot who currently employs
staff to do price-matching. Why not do this automatically?
